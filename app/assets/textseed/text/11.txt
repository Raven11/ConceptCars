			<h2>Honda FC Sport</h2>
				
			<p>The geometric shapes of the FC Sport from Honda Motor (<a href="http://stockmarket.businessweek.com/www/search.html?q=HMC">HMC</a>) recall late '80's styling. The three-seater runs on hydrogen, which allows the engine to be placed lower and more centrally than in most sports cars, giving the Sport a road-hugging profile. The windshield and top are slicked back, accentuating speed.<br> </p>
