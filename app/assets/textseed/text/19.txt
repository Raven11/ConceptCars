			<h2>Cadillac World Thorium Fuel Concept</h2>
				
			<p>Nicknamed the WTF, this design by Lorus Kulesus has 24 wheels in bunches of six, a grille the width of the body, and a shape that is more Darth Vader than Detroit. The company claims that every part of it can go 100 years without maintenance. Oh yeah: It's also powered by a nuclear reactor.<br> </p>
