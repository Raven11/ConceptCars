			<h2>Toyota FT-EV</h2>
				
			<p>This tiny all-electric from Toyota Motor (<a href="http://stockmarket.businessweek.com/www/search.html?q=TM">TM</a>) is more about the environment than looks. Its stubby front end and odd headlamp/grille section showcase its lack of a traditional motor. The minicar is golf-cart small and cute as a kid's toy.<br> </p>
