			<h2>Lincoln C</h2>
				
			<p>The four-door C from Ford Motor's (<a href="http://stockmarket.businessweek.com/www/search.html?q=F">F</a>) Lincoln division turns a Ford Focus chassis into a roadster. Its short, wide frame conveys stability while the hood and grille are reminiscent of past luxury models. The low glass top gives it a sporty, convertible look.<br> </p>
