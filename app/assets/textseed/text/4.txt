			<h2>Volkswagen Bluesport</h2>
				
			<p>VW doesn't conjure an image of sports cars but this speedy roadster could make that happen. The car showcases VW's no-frills efficiency&mdash;it gets 42 mpg&mdash;but the tall, contoured hood and fenders draw from old-school muscle cars. Under the hood, there's a surprise: a turbodiesel engine.<br> </p>
